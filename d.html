In case of websites, this code can be viewed by anyone using various tools, even your web browser itself. However, this is a little difficult on Android and iOS phones. For troubleshooting most problems with a website, it is essential to look at its source code. You can also see any website's source code for educational purposes, and see how it works. However, we advise not to copy the code for your own website, unless explicitly allowed, as that may infringe on the developer's or website owner's copyright. About Image for Source Code Using view-source to read a website's HTML code In most cases, you can see any website's source code by clicking on your browser's location bar, and entering view-source:, followed by the full URL of the page (e.g. view-source:https://www.view-page-source.com/). However, this is not always possible, especially on mobile devices. What this site does The tool on this website solves this problem, and allows you to view the formatted version of the source code of any website. Simply copy the site's URL and paste it above. Then click "View source". An added benefit is that you can even read pages that may be blocked in your country, or by your ISP. We request you to use this tool for legitimate purposes only. Importance of source code for SEO The page source is also very useful when you are doing search engine optimization, or SEO. A search engine only sees the website's source code. Even if your web page looks perfectly fine to you, it may not match the standards required by a search engine crawler. Make it a habit to look through the code, especially the important header tags, such as title, and description. Read more about this on our guide on how to optimize SEO with source code.
